This project was created using the ESP8266 module. The sensor contained in the device consists of a MQ2 gas sensor and a DHT11 temperature sensor. The actuator used is a servo motor which is useful for automatic fish feeding systems.
The tool can be controlled and monitored through the Telegram application on a smartphone.
